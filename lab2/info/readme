rbfapproximation is for doing the least square RBF.

sin2x contains the approximation for the function sin(2x), 
The figures called sin2x_something are testruns for the sin2x approxaimtion with different number of hidden units.

square2x contains the approximation for the function square(2x).
The figures called square2x_something are testruns for the square2x approxaimtion with different number of hidden units.

square2xthreasholded is square2x but using a sign function to threashold the output.

testDiter and sampleDiter are for testing the delta rule of the RBF network. testDiter does one run
to try and get below error 0.01. sampleDiter does multiple runs to test the effect eta, number of units and number of iterations has on the error.

ownfunction is for testing approximating other functions with least square.

Files vq and em is for section 5 and running the comamnd for vector quantization and expectation maximization.

ballistics does one run of teh ballistics data in section 6.
ballisticsUnitsAndLowPass does multiple runs of ballistics to test how the error depends on the number of units aswell as to test if lowpass filtering helps.
Unfortunally it doesn't seem like the lowpass filtering is completly right since it should probably make the alrotightm perform better since we should get rid of noise.
Matlab seems to have inbuilt functions for doing lowpass filtering but it didn't help.

What needs to be done:

Answer unanswered questions in file questionsandanswers.

Make the lowpass filtering work correctly. (maybe not neccessary since it seems to be an optional question)

Plots and graphs for questions/runs in section 5 to section 6.
